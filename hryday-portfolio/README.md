# Hryday Portfolio

A fast, single-page, no-dependency portfolio that showcases projects, skills, and contact.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` locally to preview.
2. Deploy with **GitHub Pages**:
   - Create a repo named `hryday-portfolio` (or any name).
   - Push these files.
   - In repo settings → Pages → set Source = `main` branch, `/ (root)`.
   - Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.
3. Or deploy with **Netlify**:
   - Drag-and-drop this folder onto https://app.netlify.com/drop
   - (Optional) enable Netlify Forms using the contact form name `contact`.

## Customize
- Replace `assets/thumb.svg` with real screenshots for each project.
- Update project links in the Projects grid.
- Edit copy in `index.html` (About, Skills).
- Colors: tweak CSS variables at the top of the `<style>` block.

## Notes
- This template is accessible-first (semantic headings, labels, high contrast).
- No JS frameworks — loads instantly.
